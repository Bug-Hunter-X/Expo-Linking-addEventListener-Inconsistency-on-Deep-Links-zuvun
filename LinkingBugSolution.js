The unreliable behavior of `Linking.addEventListener` can be mitigated by using a combination of approaches:

1. **Initial Check:** Check for initial deep links upon app launch using `Linking.getInitialURLAsync()`. This catches cases where a deep link was received before the event listener was added.

2. **Prefetching:** Before adding the event listener, try prefetching the URL to see if it is already available.

3. **Error Handling (though unlikely to provide direct error here):**  Include basic error handling around `Linking` operations.  While unlikely to provide an error message for this specific issue, good practice involves error handling.

4. **Redundant Listener (Use with Caution):** Consider adding the event listener multiple times with a check to ensure only one listener is active.  This can mitigate missed events, but it's important to manage this carefully to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

Here's an example of a more robust implementation:

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [initialUrl, setInitialUrl] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleDeepLink = (event) => {
      console.log('Deep Link Received:', event.url);
      // Handle your deep link logic here
    };

    const fetchInitialUrl = async () => {
      const url = await Linking.getInitialURLAsync();
      if (url) {
        setInitialUrl(url);
      }
    };

    fetchInitialUrl();

    const subscription = Linking.addEventListener('url', handleDeepLink);

    return () => subscription.remove();
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (initialUrl) {
      console.log('Initial Deep Link:', initialUrl);
      // Handle your deep link logic here
    }
  }, [initialUrl]);

  // ... rest of your app
}

export default App;
```

This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  Under certain conditions, particularly when the app is launched from a cold start or after being killed by the operating system, the `Linking.addEventListener` might not fire, preventing the app from handling deep links correctly. This is especially frustrating since there is no immediate, obvious error message. The app seems to just ignore the deep link entirely.
